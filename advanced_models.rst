Advanced Models
---------------------------------------------

.. warning::

   These tutorials have not yet been updated for CellBlender 1.0. Therefore,
   some things might not work exactly as described.

What follows is a series of advanced MCell and CellBlender models each of which
serves a unique purpose. Some examples (e.g. :ref:`fick`) teach fundamentals
which are critical for understanding both the physical and chemical laws upon
which MCell's algorithms are based. Other examples (e.g. :ref:`rat`) show
models which either have been used as actual research projects or could form
the basis of such projects.

.. note::

   It is assumed that you have already gone through tutorials 1-5 prior to
   attempting these.
