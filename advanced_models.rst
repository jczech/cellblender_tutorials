Advanced Models
---------------------------------------------

What follows is a series of advanced MCell and CellBlender models each of which
serves a unique purpose. Some examples (e.g. :ref:`fick`) teach fundamentals
which are critical for understanding both the physical and chemical laws upon
which MCell's algorithms are based. Other examples (e.g. :ref:`rat`) show
models which either have been used as actual research projects or could form
the basis of such projects.

.. note::

   It is assumed that you have already gone through tutorials 1-4 prior to
   attempting these.
