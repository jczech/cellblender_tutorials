Organelle Model
===============

.. a comment is marked with '..'

.. each example can have a short description on what features it shows
   and what can be seen by simulating the model, I think that just a high level description 
   is sufficient
   maybe we can put it in a way that it will be for people that are looking how to implement 
   certain things in their models  


Demonstrated features
=====================
   
- Geometry of a cell with two organelles
- Volume + volume and volume + surface reactions with transport
- Volume and surface molecule releases
