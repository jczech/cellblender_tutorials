============================
Variable Rate Constant Model
============================

Description
===========

Volume molecules **vm** are placed inside a cube and disappear accordingly to the following reaction (**vm** -> NULL). The rate constant of this reaction is variable, it is given by the text file rate_constant.txt, it is zero before time step :math:`5.10^{-4}` s and :math:`1.10^{4} s^{-1}` afterwards.


Demonstrated features
=====================

- A variable rate constant is implemented in this example.
