Fick's Law 1D Model
===============

Description
===========

In this example we assess Fick's laws in 1D, using discrete diffusing particles and an elongated rectangle (an extended tutorial on how to build the model can be found here: :ref:`fick`).

Demonstrated features
=====================

- Multiple objects are created to measure the number of particles at different locations.
- Surface classes are used to make objects transparent and absorptive.
- Model parameters are employed.
- Release of a defined number of molecules.
