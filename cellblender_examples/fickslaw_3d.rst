===================
Fick's Law 3D Model
===================

Description
===========

This example is similar to :ref:`ficks_1d` but we now assess Fick's laws in 3D, using discrete diffusing particles and spheres.

Demonstrated features
=====================

- Multiple spheres are created to measure the number of particles at different locations.
- A surface class is used to make objects transparent.
- Model parameters are employed.
- Release of a defined number of molecules.
