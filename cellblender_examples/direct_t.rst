Description
===========

With this example we illustrate the usage of reactions with absolute orientation. Volume molecules **v**
in the interior of a cube react with surface molecules **s**, producing volume molecules **r** in the
exterior of the cube (reaction **v@IN** + **s** -> **s** + **r@OUT**).


Demonstrated features
=====================

- Reactions with absolute orientation.
