MCell Installation
*********************************************

MCell Overview
---------------------------------------------

MCell is available for Linux, OS X, and Windows. In the past, MCell was run
exclusively from the command line. With the development of CellBlender, this is
no longer necessary (although it can still be very useful). MCell, by itself,
does not have a graphical user interface and cannot be run by double-clicking
an icon. Also, there is no installer unlike many Windows applications.

Download MCell
---------------------------------------------

Download the desired binary file for your system (e.g., MCell v. |release| for
Linux x86) from the `MMBioS web site`_.
