MCell Installation
*********************************************

.. note::

    MCell is included in the CellBlender 1.1 bundle (linux_, windows_). You
    only need to install MCell separately if you would like to run it outside
    of CellBlender or if you are setting up CellBlender from scratch (as is
    needed on OSX).

MCell Overview
---------------------------------------------

MCell is available for Linux, OS X, and Windows. In the past, MCell was run
exclusively from the command line. With the development of CellBlender, this is
no longer necessary (although it can still be very useful). MCell, by itself,
does not have a graphical user interface and cannot be run by double-clicking
an icon. Also, there is no installer unlike many Windows applications.

Download MCell
---------------------------------------------

Download the desired binary file for your system (e.g., MCell v3.4 for
Windows) from the `MMBioS web site`_.
