MCell Installation
*********************************************

MCell Overview
---------------------------------------------

MCell is run from the command line, whether you are running \*nix (e.g. UNIX,
Linux), Windows, or Mac OS X. For many reasons, we strongly recommend that you
run MCell on \*nix or OS X. MCell does not have a graphical user interface and
cannot be run by double-clicking an icon (Windows users take note). You must be
a registered user to download MCell from our `web site`_.

.. _web site: http://mcell.org/download.html

Installing MCell for Linux/OS X
---------------------------------------------

Download and Extract MCell
=============================================

Download the desired binary file for your system (e.g., MCell v. |release| for
Linux x86).

The binary file that you download is a gzipâ€™ed file with a name that ends in
".gz". Your browser may think that it knows more than you do and automatically
unzip the file without changing its name (this can lead to considerable
confusion).

Assuming that your browser hasn't already done so, unzip the file, e.g.,

::

    gunzip mcell-3.1.998_x86.gz

If this succeeds, the file will no longer have the .gz suffix. If it fails and
you get an error message, it's probably already been unzipped by your browser.
In this case just continue with the next step, but remember to include the
".gz" suffix on the file name.

Rename and Make Executable
=============================================

Rename the file to something more convenient and make it executable, e.g.,

::

    mv mcell-3.1.998_x86 mcell
    chmod a+x mcell

Put MCell in a PATH Directory
=============================================

Depending on your preferences, you may want to put the resulting executable
binary in an appropriate place for yourself or all the users of the machine
(e.g., ``sudo mv mcell /usr/local/bin`` if you have root privileges). If you do
not have root privileges, then you can put it in your home directory (e.g.
``mkdir /home/user/bin; mv mcell home/user/bin`` where **user** is your user
name). However, you need to make sure that the directory you put it in is
either in your PATH_ or that you add it to your PATH. You can do this by typing
``export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/bin`` (once again, **user** should be your user
name)

.. _PATH: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29

Verify correct function by typing the name of the executable at a command
prompt, e.g.,

::

    mcell

If you have put MCell in an appropriate directory included in your path for
executables, you should see a startup message followed by an error that
indicates no MDL (Model Description Language) file has been specified. MDL
files are used to design and control MCell simulations (see MCell tutorials).
