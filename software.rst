Although Windows is now a supported platform, some of the more advanced
tutorials are still geared towards users of linux (e.g. Ubuntu_) or OS X. Some
basic familiarity with the command line will be useful in later sections. There
are many tutorials online that explain the basics, like `this one`_. Although
no previous knowledge of Blender or Python is required, the goal of these
tutorials is not to teach these topics. There are already many good resources
available to learn about these subjects (e.g.  `Python tutorials`_ and `Blender
tutorials`_).
