Required Software
************************

Before starting these tutorials, you *need* to download the CellBlender 1.1
bundle (linux_, osx_, windows_). Unlike previous versions of CellBlender, this
should include everything you need to create, run, and visualize your
simulations. Simply download, extract the zip file, and start Blender.

.. note::

    The vast majority of users will want to use the CellBlender 1.1 bundle
    (linux_, osx_, windows_), but advanced users may want to install
    CellBlender from scratch. They will need to manually install the following
    pieces:

    * MCell |version| (:ref:`mcell_install`)
    * `Blender 2.78`_ (older versions may or may not work)
    * CellBlender 1.1 (:ref:`cellblender_install`, *note: install Blender first*)

You don't need these immediately, but you will likely find them necessary later
on:

* A text editor (gedit_, vim_, emacs_, etc.)
* Some graphing and analysis software (matplotlib_ (with Python_ and numpy_) or
  Grace_ are recommended)

Prerequisites
--------------------------------

* Some basic familiarity with the command line will be useful in later
  sections. There are many tutorials online that explain the basics, like `The
  Command Line Crash Course`_.
* No previous knowledge of Blender or Python is required; however, the goal of
  these tutorials is not to teach these topics. There are already many good
  resources available to learn about these subjects (e.g. `Python tutorials`_).

The Next Step
--------------------------------

After you have downloaded, extracted, and started the CellBlender bundle, you
should continue with the :ref:`single_molecule_diffusion` tutorial.
