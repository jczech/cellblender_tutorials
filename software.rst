These tutorials assume you are using either some version of linux (e.g.
Ubuntu_) or OSX as your operating system. It also requires that you have some
basic familiarity with the command line. There are many tutorials online that
explain the basics, like `this one`_. Although no previous knowledge of Blender
or python is required, the goal of these tutorials is not to teach these
topics. There are already many good resources available to learn about these
subjects (e.g. `python tutorials`_ and `blender tutorials`_).
