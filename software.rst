This tutorial assumes you are using either some version of linux (e.g. Ubuntu_) or OSX as your operating system. It also requires that you have some basic familiarity with the command line. There are many tutorials online that explain the basics, like `this one`_. Although no previous knowledge of Blender, DReAMM, or python is required, the goal of this tutorial is not to teach these topics. There are already many good resources available to learn about these subjects.
