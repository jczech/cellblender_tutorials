************************
Required Software
************************

Before starting these tutorials, you *need* to install the following software:

* MCell 3.3 (:ref:`mcell_install`)
* `Blender 2.74`_ (older versions may or may not work)
* CellBlender 1.0.1 (:ref:`cellblender_install`, *note: install Blender first*)
You don't need these immediately, but you will likely find them necessary later
on:

* A text editor (gedit_, vim_, emacs_, etc.)
* Some graphing and analysis software (matplotlib_ (with Python_ and numpy_) or
  Grace_ are recommended)

.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

.. _numpy: http://numpy.scipy.org/

.. note::
   
   Although Windows is now a supported platform, some of the more advanced
   tutorials are still geared towards users of linux (e.g. Ubuntu_) or OS X.

Prerequisites
--------------------------------

* Some basic familiarity with the command line will be useful in later
  sections. There are many tutorials online that explain the basics, like `The
  Command Line Crash Course`_.
* No previous knowledge of Blender or Python is required; however, the goal of
  these tutorials is not to teach these topics. There are already many good
  resources available to learn about these subjects (e.g. `Python tutorials`_
  and `Blender tutorials`_).

The Next Step
--------------------------------

After you have installed MCell, Blender, and CellBlender, you should continue
with the :ref:`single_molecule_diffusion` tutorial.
