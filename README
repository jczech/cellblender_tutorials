README for CellBlender and MCell Tutorials

The CellBlender and MCell tutorials located at
http://www.mcell.psc.edu/tutorials/ are generated using Sphinx
(http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html). If Sphinx is installed, the html files can
be generated by using the command "make html" in this directory.

Some of the binary files are not stored in the repo to keep the size of it
small, but that policy will likely change if more collaborators need to
contribute images.
