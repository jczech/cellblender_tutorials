Introduction to MCell and CellBlender
=====================================

In order to quickly show what can be done with MCell and CellBlender, we'll
create a simple model with a cube that has diffusing surface and volume
molecules that react with each other to create new molecules. Afterwards, we
will visualize the molecules and plot the reaction data all from within
CellBlender. All of this will be accomplished in sections 1-4.

Much of the theory will be skipped over, as it's available elsewhere_. For a
more detailed explanation of any given topic, please see the quick reference
guide (pdf_, html_). 

..
  Leave this commented out until we update the project files.

  The completed project files for sections 1-13 can be downloaded here_. You
  will generate these same files simply by following along with these
  tutorials, but they are provided here in case you need them for any reason.
